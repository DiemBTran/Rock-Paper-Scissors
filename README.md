It is January 2020. Bach and I are moving onto the next big project. We are to make a program with which you can play Rock Paper Scissors. The computer will have three choices: rock, paper, or scissors. The play will have the same three choices. Thus, there are nine possible outcomes (win, lose, tie for all three choices) against the computer's moves. The program should also return a string that declares the winner of the round. we must make the functino case insensitive so that the user may type "rock," "ROCK," or "rOcK." We must also write a new function called game() that keeps score of te winner or loser at the end.
